### Description
Nearly complete narrative - missing the last scene. Begins with two characters in the rain. One with an umbrella and one without. The one with goes over to the one without and they start walking. The walk and end up falling into a fuddle which is like the rabbit hole from Alice in Wonderland. The last scene will be character 1 waking up confused or something along those lines.
