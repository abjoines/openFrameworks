### Description
The three things I did were to make the character mad, surprised, and excited. For mad I created a button which changed the background and character's body/eyes to red. For surprised I used a float slider to change the radius of the inner eyes. For excited I created an int slider (just for variety's sake - otherwise I would've used a float slider) which makes the whole character move up and down.
