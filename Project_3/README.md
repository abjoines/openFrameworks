### Description

I currently have all of the graphic elements finished. All I have left to do are the interactions. The game is like the peripheral vision test but there are rotating triangles which pop up and when the circle (player's mouse pos) hits one of the triangles a point will be scored. When the user misses a triangle or a certain number of triangles (I haven't decided) the game will end with the option to restart.
