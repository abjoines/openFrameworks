### Description

I currently have all of the graphic elements finished. All I have left to do it the interactions. The game is like the peripheral vision test where rotate triangles will pop up and when the circle (player's mouse pos) hits one of the triangles a point in scored. When the user missed a triangle or a certain number of triangles (I haven't decided) the game will end with the option to restart.
