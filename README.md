# openFrameworks
### Bio
I am in my 4th year of BA/BFA at Parsons and Lang: BA in Interdisciplinary Science and BFA in Design and Technology. I'm interested in openFrameworks because I want to use it to create live responsive visuals to do VJing and whatever else I find it useful for such as interactive installations.
