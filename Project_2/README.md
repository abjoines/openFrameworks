### Description

This is a prototype version of the final. I am visualizing air quality data. The Dark Sky API only has ozone so that is the only air quality data coming from an API. I am also using the visibility measurements from Dark Sky. The levels of ozone correspond to the size of the cubes. The visibility corresponds to the transparency of the cubes. The right cube is ozone while the left cube is PM2.5. I am currently manually inputing an estimate for PM2.5 until I find a good source for that data. The sliders currently are used to test how it will look at different levels of ozone or PM2.5. I haven't yet connected that to time.
