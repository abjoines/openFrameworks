### Description

This youtube video linked above shows the complete version of Project 2. I am visualizing air quality data via cubes. The Dark Sky API data that I am using is ozone and visibility. The levels of ozone and PM 2.5 correspond to the size of the cubes. The visibility corresponds to the transparency of the cubes. The right cube is ozone while the left cube is PM2.5. I am currently manually inputing an estimate for PM2.5. The sliders can be used to test how it will look at different levels of ozone or PM2.5 but you can also simply click animate and it will cycle through showing how the visualization can change. When you animate the PM2.5 and Ozone ppm levels change along with the visualization. Only upon first opening the visualization does it show the current levels and time.
