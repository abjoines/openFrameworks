### Description

This is a near complete version. I am visualizing air quality data. The Dark Sky API only has ozone so that is the only air quality data coming from an API. I am also using the visibility measurements from Dark Sky. The levels of ozone correspond to the size of the cubes. The visibility corresponds to the transparency of the cubes. The right cube is ozone while the left cube is PM2.5. I am currently manually inputing an estimate for PM2.5. The sliders can be used to test how it will look at different levels of ozone or PM2.5 but you can also simply click animate and it will cycle through showing how the visualization can change. I have now made it so that when you animate the PM2.35 and Ozone ppm levels change with the visualization.
