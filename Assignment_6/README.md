# Title Interactions

### Description
I'm having trouble toggling the title to and from the fbo. The mouse pressed interaction is a little bit buggy as well but it works well enough for now. When the mouse is dragged you draw circles, simulating moving something through water or in this case a puddle. When the mouse is clicked two solid circles radiate from the feet of one of the characters, covering up the scene and also simulating ripples in a puddle. I'm thinking this could be a good transition.
