# Project Concepts
### Project 1
Since we have to have a character with a face the narrative I've ended up with is as follows:
Character 1 enters the scene, it is raining, Char 1 jumps in a puddle. It starts raining, char 1 gets wet. Char 2 then enters and eventually offers an umbrella. After this the two characters leave. I was also thinking about doing a shot from above which shows rain dropping in the puddle (ripples). 

### Project 2
For this project I have a few different ideas I wrote down. One, if I use the weather API, is to use temperature history or rainfall history to create a topographics map. Another idea I had was to use air quality to create a fog type of visualization where the color would reflect density or air quality rating. The idea with these is to visualize the data in a way that gives the information a new kind of dimensionality. 

### Project 3
For this mini game I was thinking to do a whacka mole style game that functions the same way the peripheral vision tests do. I'm thinking of having little fuzzy shapes pop up which the user has to click on. As you progress the background will change color making it more difficult to see the shapes that pop up. For the user this should not only be a game but perhaps also a test of ones vision.
